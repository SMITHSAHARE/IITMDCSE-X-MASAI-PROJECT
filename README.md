**Tic-Tac-Toe**

This is a Python-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring a Player vs Bot (PvB) mode. Challenge the bot and see if you can outsmart it in this timeless game!

**Features**

**User-Friendly Interface**: Text-based interface that's easy to navigate.

**Dynamic Gameplay**: Real-time feedback and clear game state updates.

**Win Detection**: Automatically determines the winner or declares a draw.

**How to Play** 

The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

You are Player X, and the bot is Player O.

Players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) in empty cells.

The first to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.

If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
